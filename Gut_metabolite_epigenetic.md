# Gut microbial metabolites affect host immunity through epigenetic modification

It is becoming clear that gut microbiota and their metabolites have profound influence on host immunity. Gut microbiota produce metabolites such as 
SCFA (short-chain fatty acid) or Folates that can modulate epigenetic modifications, thereby regulate the host gene expression. Here I review current findings.

## 1. SAM (S-adenosyl methionine) on IECs

SAM is the primary substrate for DNA and histone methylation. SAM is generated from folates or methionine, both of which are synthesized by gut microbiota. Researches also show gut microbiota promotes DNA methylation in genes required for antimicrobial response, such as *Tlr4* and *Cxcl16*. In the genome scale, the existence of gut microbiota decrease methylation levels and promotes the expression of antimcrobial genes in IECs, such as genes encoding antimicrobial peptide (1-3).

## 2. SCFA (Short-chain fatty acid) on IECs
SCFA are produced from fermentation of gut microbiota, including acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4). SCFA could promotes histone acetylation through serving as acetyl donors or inhibiting HDAC (histone deacetylase) activities. The mechanism underlying the inhibition of HDAC by SCFA is still unclear, probably through acting as competitive inhibitors of HDAC. The influence of SCFA on epigenetic programming is not only limited in IECs, but can also extend to other tissues such as liver and adipose tissues. Genes affected by SCFA in IECs are mostly antimicrobial response and lipid metabolism (4-7).

## 3. SCFA on T cells
SCFA can directly affect histone acetylation in T cells. In regulatory T cells (Treg), SCFA can promotes histone 3 acetylation in the promoter region of *Foxp3* gene, and enhances Treg homeostasis. SCFA also also promotes the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in both Th1 and Th17 cells, although the detailed mechanism is unclear. Lastly, SCFA can help the formation of memory CD8+ T cells - cells that help to maintain long-term immunity against pathogens (8-15).
