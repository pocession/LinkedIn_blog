# Immunological memory

During my whole career, I have conducted researches related to immunological memory for > 8 years. It is a good moment to summarize my knowledge in this field.

Immunological memory comes from three part:

1. The immature T and B cells, which have underwent gene rearrangement and become naive T and B cells. These cells stay in primary lymphoid organs and can respond to specific antigens. However, without continuous stimulation of antigens, most naive T and B cells could fade out within years. This memory last for weeks or years.

2. The second layer of memory comes from memory T and B cells. Under certain conditions, e.g. weak TCR signaling and sufficient supply of IL-2, memory T and B cells could be generated from either naive or activated T and B cells. This memory can last for decades and even the whole life.

3. Finally, innate immune cells also provide memory and IL-1 is the key cytokine. IL-1, which is produced due to previous infection, helps to perform epigenetic reprogramming in HSPC and make the differentiation towards myelopoiesis. IL-1 also direct the epigenetic reprogramming in peripheral monocytes. This process makes innate immune cells "remember" pathogens and respond to pathogens immediately in next time. The memory from innate immune cells could even last for years. The immunological memory from innate immune cells is now entitled as "trained immunity" and is the reason why BCG vaccine can decrease the morbidity rate of some populations.
