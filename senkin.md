ðŸš€ Exciting JavaScript Project Showcase: Senkin ðŸš€
I am thrilled to share some updates of my latest JavaScript project, Senkin! ðŸŽ‰

Senkin is a captivating game that challenges your vocabulary and reflexes. It's designed to enhance your language skills while providing an enjoyable gaming experience.

ðŸŽ® How Senkin Works:
Senkin presents players with a series of word combinations and requires them to select the correct answer within a given time limit. The game randomly selects a problem from a predefined dataset, and players need to click on the correct answer from the available options.

ðŸ“Š Features and Highlights:
Dynamic Generation: The game dynamically generates word combinations, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting.
Score Tracking: Senkin keeps track of the player's score, displayed prominently on the screen.
Timer: A countdown timer challenges players to answer quickly, adding an element of excitement and urgency to the game.
Feedback: The game provides visual feedback by changing the background color of selected options based on their correctness.


Last and nerdy:
ðŸ”¥ Technologies Used in this project includes HTML, CSS, Javascript. No JQuery libraries!
