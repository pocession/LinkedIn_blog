Droplet-based single cell sequencing method is a powerful tool in omics study. Within a standard droplet generator, cells are first mixed with oil-encapsulated droplet and undergo a series of biochemical reactions. This process generates a collection of droplets and each droplet contains oligo-indexed heredity materials from a single cell. However, to prevent more than two cells are loaded into one droplet, most of droplets have to be remained empty. Those droplets are still sequenced and it creates a huge waste of sequencing throughput. To reduce the waste, a method called scifi-RNA-seq was invented by Paul Datlinger et. al. This method utilizes a specific barcoding strategy to preindex >150K cells in 96-well plates and more than one cells are overloaded into one droplet. The throughput is significantly increased by 15X.



We are implementing scifi-RNA-seq in our lab and hope to reduce the general costing. I also create a small app to generate files compatible with 10X format. Please check out my github for more information.
