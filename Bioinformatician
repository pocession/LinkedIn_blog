## Five types of Bioinormaticians

I always think Bioinformatician mainly focus on "next generation sequencing (NGS)" data. Turns out, in the industry world, people expect at least 5 types of Bioinformaticians:

1. Omics Bioiformatician: they use computational tools to analyze complex biological data such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. In most of cases, data come from NGS.

2. Computational Bioinformatician: they mainly develop and apply computational algorithms to solve biological problems such as gene expression analysis, network analysis, and phylogenetics.

3. Statistics bioinformatician, or called Biostatistician: they use statistical methods to analyze biological data and design experiments to test hypotheses. Commonly used methods include regression, ANOVA, various of two sample tests.

4. Clinical Bioinformatician or Informatics Specialists: they develop and manages clinical information systems and databases to support healthcare delivery and research. They are more like typical software developers.

5. Data Bioinformatician or Data Scientist: they apply statistical and computational techniques to analyze complex biological data, identify patterns, and develop predictive models.

These are just a few examples, and there may be overlap between these roles. The specific skills and expertise required for a particular job in bioinformatics may vary depending on the employer, the specific field of biology, and the project being worked on
