# Methylkit is a powerful tool for identifying DNA methylation differences between two groups.

To find out DNA methylation changes caused by experimental factors, e.g. presence of microbiome, aging, we need to compare the whole-genome DNA methylation status and identify the differentially-methylated regions (DMRs) between two groups. Methylkit is a powerful tool helping us to achieve this. A workflow of Methylkit package is shown here.
